//--------- VetTube ---------//
Developers: Christopher Molitoris & Mathew Taylor

Created after and inspired by YouTube. Utilizes Django/Python backend REST API and SQL database. Maintains capabilities such as searching for a video or channel and allowing the user to parse the results as well as other recommended videos related to the one selected. The user can then create/add a comment to the video and reply to other comments which are stored within the database. Along with the video presented an algorithm is used to reformat text found within the JSON request (description) to display it as it were to be on YouTube, itself. Calls to the YouTube V3 API and our Django API are made with Axios.
